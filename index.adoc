// ------------------------------- What is JVM --------------------------------

== What is JVM

=== Let's see by example

[source, scala]
--
object Test {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    val a = 1
    val b = 2
    val c = a + b
    println(c)
  }
}
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Let's see how Java version would look like.
--

=== Let's see by example

[source, java]
--
class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    int c = a + b;
    scala.Predef$.MODULE$.println(
      scala.runtime.BoxRunTime.boxToInteger(c)
    );
  }
}
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
`println` is imported from `scala.Predef`.
`MODULE` stores an instance of `scala.Predef`.
`println` doesn't take ints so they have to be converted. 
Now, lets see how bytecode would look like.
--

=== Let's see by example

[source, x86asm]
--
 0: iconst_1
 1: istore_2
 2: iconst_2
 3: istore_3
 4: iload_2
 5: iload_3
 6: iadd
 7: istore 4
 9: getstatic #22; scala.Predef$.MODULE$ : scala.Predef$
12: iload 4
14: invokestatic #28 ; scala.runtime.BoxesRunTime
                     ; .boxToInteger(int): java.lang.Integer
17: invokevirtual #32
; scala.Predef$.println(java.lang.Object): void
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
This looks intimidating so let's draw it on a piece of paper.
At first the additon part.

=== How bytecode works

image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 5.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We have list of instructions on left, variables are using numbers, so compiler translates each name to a distinct number. In order to execute some instruction we'll use stacks to pass things around.

We finished the addition part, so small reminder where we are in the original code.
--

[transition=none]
=== Reminder

[source, java]
--
class Test {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int a = 1;
    int b = 2;
    int c = a + b;
    // we finished here
    scala.Predef$.MODULE$.println(
      scala.runtime.BoxRunTime.boxToInteger(c)
    );
  }
}
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
So, why println doesn't accept `int`?
--

=== How bytecode works

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Primitives - basically boolean and numbers.
References - everything else.
Void - lack of returned value which has a special treatment.

[NOTE.speaker]

The calls were quite interesting so let's stop for a minute.
--

=== Calls and returns

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 20.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
The calls were quite interesting so let's stop for a minute. Static calls take only arguments, virtual take also object (because method might be polymorphic).
--

=== Stack traces

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 21.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
All we had before - which method we are in, program counter, local variables, operand stack - live inside a `Frame`. When we make a call we create a new Frame and when we return we destroy the current one and return to immediate previous `Frame`.
--


// ------------------------ JVM types vs Scala types --------------------------

== JVM types vs Scala types

=== Scala type hierarchy

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 3.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
We have a top type and a bottom type. Unit is a normal type with a value. While Scala distinguishes between primitive types and reference types, it is most of the time transparent to us.
--

=== Java type hierarchy

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 4.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Primitives are special. Void is special. There is no bottom type. There are function that would not compose, e.g. everything returning void. Suppliers (no arguments), Consumers (no returns).
--

=== Comparison

[%step]
* `scala.AnyVal` s are automatically compiled to primitives OR boxed if needed, so they are dscribed using separate types
* there is `scala.Null` subtype of all references
* there is `scala.Nothing` subtype of all types

[NOTE.speaker]
--
A few more words about numbers.
--

=== A bit more about numbers

[%step]
* JVM primitives are separate types with no common sub- or supertype
* however they can be boxed with subclasses of `java.lang.Number` to share an interface
* Scala's numbers share `AnyVal` which has no common numeric methods, so instead we rely on `scala.Numeric` type class

=== Generics

[source, scala]
--
// what we see

def head[A](nel: NonEmptyList[A]): A = ...

val value: String = head(stringNel)
--

[source, scala]
--
// pseudocode of what JVM sees

// List can only contain java.lang.Object
def head(list: NonEmptyList): java.lang.Object = ...

// stringNel forgot its type parameter
val value: String = headOption(stringNel)
    .asInstanceOf[String] // so we have to retrieve it
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Type erasure instead of reified types, they are actually useful because it allows us to implement things that Java's type system wouldn't allow.
Drawbacks are usually addressed with `@specialize`. Exception is reflection which might be difficult to use with generic methods.
--



// -------------------------------- Threads -----------------------------------

== Threads

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Natively supported since JDK 1.0, released at January 23, 1996.
--

=== In application

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 22.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Map to operating system threads. Are expensice to create so we should try to reuse them instead of creating them anew.
--

=== Creating a thread

[source, scala]
--
// nothing interesting
val thread = new Thread()
thread.start()
--

[source, scala]
--
// passing Runnable
val thread = new Thread(() => println("started"))
thread.start()
--

[source, scala]
--
// extending Thread
val thread = new Thread {
  override def run(): Unit = println("started")
}
thread.start()
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Creating threads is that simple.
--

=== Thread pools

[source, scala]
--
// 10 threads that could run submited tasks in parallel
val executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10)
executorService.submit(() => println("started"))
--

[source, scala]
--
implicit val ec: ExecutionContext =
    ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(executorService)
// use in e.g. Future
--

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Thread pools let us reuse a thread, instead of letting it die after `Runnable` finishes.
This is used by `Future`, `IO`, `Task`, Akka, etc to run things.
`ExecutionContext` and `Scheduler` are just wrappers.
Mention blocking threads, IO, and the need to handle that.
--



// ----------------------------- Optimizations --------------------------------

== Optimizations

[NOTE.speaker]
--
If JVM was only emulator of non-existend processor it would be pretty slow. However that's not the case. How it's possible? HotSpot.
--

=== Compilers

[.handle-img]
[.rotate-img]
image::Scala and JVM/Scala and JVM - page 23.png[]

[NOTE.speaker]
--
`-XX:MaxTrivialSize=6`, `-XX:MaxInlineSize=35`, `-FreqInlineSize=325` (bytes), there are limits on inlining `-XX:MaxInlineLevel=9`, `-XX:InlineSmallCode=1000`.
--

=== Examples

[%step]
* inlining
* loop unrooling
* null check elimination
* dead code elimination
* escape analysis
* devirtualization
* constant folding
* ...

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Inlining is the mother of all optimizations.
Devirtualization relies on knowing how many implementations are in the runtime.
--

=== Some takeaways

[%step]
* JVM prefers short method (inlining and compilation)
* JVM prefers not-too-deep call stack (ditto)
* JVM perfers simple code (easier to optimize)
* JVM prefers if we limit amount of implementations in the runtime (devirtualization -> inlining)
* a lot of optimizations we would do manually is aalredy done by JVM itself, so before doing anything - learn how to benchmark

[NOTE.speaker]
--
Deep hierarchies, refletion, Fabio Brazill's example with Map.

// -------------------------------- Summary -----------------------------------

== Summary

[%step]
* you cannot escape from JVM's idiosyncracies forever, so it's better to understand it
* even with FP libraires sometimes knowledge about low-level stuff is important
* if you want to be able to optimize you program, you HAVE to learn some basics
